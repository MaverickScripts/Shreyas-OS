# Shreyas-OS
Built a lightweight custom mini-OS in C with a Unix-like shell, supporting file management (ls, cat, write, edit), process/task control (ps, spawn, kill, suspend/resume), and system utilities (uptime, compile, IP lookup). Designed for modularity and extensibility, blending low-level programming with a user-friendly command-line interface.


Custom Mini-OS (C Language)

A lightweight Unix-like mini operating system, engineered entirely in C, featuring a sleek command-line shell with file management, process control, and system utilities.
Unlike typical academic builds, this OS is modular, extensible, and user-friendly, showcasing low-level programming, memory optimization, and system-level innovation.

‚ú® Features

File Management: ls, cat, write, append, touch, rm, edit

Process & Task Control: spawn, addtask, ps, killtask, suspend, resume

System Utilities: uptime, poweroff, powerbtn, clear, echo, version

Compilation & Execution: compile <file>, run <command>

Networking: ip (view system IP addresses)

Import/Export: move files between virtual FS and host disk

‚ö° Getting Started
üîß Requirements

GCC / Clang (Linux/macOS)

MinGW (Windows, with -lws2_32 for Winsock support)

üõ† Build Instructions
# Linux / macOS
gcc main.c -o mini-os

# Windows (MinGW)
gcc main.c -o mini-os.exe -lws2_32

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the OS
./mini-os

üìÇ Project Structure
mini-os/
‚îÇ‚îÄ‚îÄ main.c        # Core OS logic & shell
‚îÇ‚îÄ‚îÄ vfs/          # Virtual File System (managed internally)
‚îÇ‚îÄ‚îÄ tasks/        # Task manager
‚îÇ‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md     # Project documentation

üöÄ Example Usage
> touch hello.txt
> write hello.txt "Hello World!"
> cat hello.txt
Hello World!
> addtask reminder 5 "Take a break!"
> ps
ID | Task        | Status
1  | reminder    | Running

üìå Notes

Runs inside a virtual shell, not a real kernel.

Designed for educational & experimental purposes.

Modular ‚Äî new commands/utilities can be easily added.
