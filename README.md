# Shreyas-OS
Built a lightweight custom mini-OS in C with a Unix-like shell, supporting file management (ls, cat, write, edit), process/task control (ps, spawn, kill, suspend/resume), and system utilities (uptime, compile, IP lookup). Designed for modularity and extensibility, blending low-level programming with a user-friendly command-line interface.
